**Learning:** List items that trigger navigation or dialogs (like Prompt Management) can feel static without visual cues. Users may not realize they are tappable.
**Action:** Always include a trailing icon (e.g., `chevron_right`, `edit_outlined`) or action button on interactive list tiles to improve discoverability and match the app's pattern (seen in Chat History).
