## 2024-05-23 - Explicit List Item Affordance
**Learning:** List items that trigger navigation or dialogs (like Prompt Management) can feel static without visual cues. Users may not realize they are tappable.
**Action:** Always include a trailing icon (e.g., `chevron_right`, `edit_outlined`) or action button on interactive list tiles to improve discoverability and match the app's pattern (seen in Chat History).

## 2026-01-31 - Actionable Empty States in Modals
**Learning:** In modal views (like `TemplatesSheet`), relying solely on header buttons for primary creation actions can lead to "dead" empty states. Users expect the center of the screen to guide them when content is missing.
**Action:** Always include a prominent Call-to-Action (CTA) button in the empty state body, even if a duplicate action exists in the header, to reduce friction and improve discoverability.
